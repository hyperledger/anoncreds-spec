# AnonCreds Specification

![AnonCreds Logo](/spec/images/logo/hl_anoncreds_colour.svg)

This repository contains the source content for the AnonCreds open
specification, a part of the [Hyperledger AnonCreds
Project](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/anoncreds). This open
specification is based on the open source AnonCreds verifiable credential
implementation in the Hyperledger AnonCreds GitHub repository
[anoncreds-rs](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-rs). That implementation
was originally part of the [Hyperledger
Indy](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy) open source
project, accepted into Hyperledger in 2017. The extensive use of AnonCreds
around the world has made it a de facto standard, and the AnonCreds Working
Group (hyperledger) has been established to formalize the specification and
place it on a standards track.

## Background

The scope and background for this work can be found in the [Scope](2._Scope.md) in
this repository. The <tl;dr> summary is the following:

The open source AnonCreds implementations
([here](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/src/api/anoncreds.rs)
in [Hyperledger
Indy](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy) and [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-rs)) in [Hyperledger AnonCreds](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/anoncreds)
provide
capabilities that many see as important for digital identity use cases in
particular, and verifiable data in general. These features include:

- A full implementation of the Layer 3 verifiable credential “Trust Triangle” of the [Trust over IP Model](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/).
- Complete flows for issuing verifiable credentials (Issuer to Holder), and requesting, generating and verifying presentations of verifiable claims (Holder to Verifier).
- Fully defined data models for all of the objects in the flows, including verifiable credentials, presentation requests and presentations sourced from multiple credentials.
- Fully defined applications of cryptographic primitives.
- The use of Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) in the verifiable presentation process to enhance the privacy protections available to the holder in presenting data to verifiers, including:
  - Blinding issuer signatures to prevent correlation based on those signatures.
  - Holder binding based on the use of unrevealed identifiers to prevent correlation based a holder identifier.
  - Selective disclosure in the generation of presentations to minimize data sharing to that required for the business need.
  - The use of predicate proofs to reduce the sharing of PII and potentially correlating data, especially dates (birth, credential issuance/expiry, etc.).
  - A revocation scheme that proves a presentation is based on credentials that have not been revoked by the issuers without revealing correlatable revocation identifiers.

The AnonCreds working group is producing an AnonCreds v1.0 specification that
describes the existing implementation minus any dependency on the Hyperledger
Indy ledger ("ledger-agnostic"). Once sufficient progress has been made on the v1.0 specification, a
forward looking version will be started that evolves the specification to add
new elements while retaining the core features of AnonCreds (listed above). Such
a future version is likely to include features such as replacing CL Signatures
with BBS+ Signatures, defining a more scalable revocation scheme. Those participating in this Working Group will define the exact direction
of future versions of the AnonCreds specification.

## Contributions

This work is being carried out under the [Community Specification License
v1.0](1._Community_Specification_License-v1.md). Any person or organization
willing to adhere to this license is welcome to participate in this Working
Group and contribute to the development of the specification. Please read the
[Contributions](6._Contributing.md) document in this repo for details. For those
unfamiliar with the Community Specification License, you can think of it as
analogous to an open source code license, such as Apache 2.0, but for
specifications.

All participants in this working group must follow the group's [Code of Conduct](8._Code_of_Conduct.md).

## Meetings

Meetings of the Working Group are held weekly on Mondays at 7AM
Pacific/Vancouver time. That is 16:00 CET for most of the year, except for the
periods around the daylight savings time changes. Meeting details, agendas,
notes and links to the recordings are posted on the repository Wiki (to be done).

## Working Group Communications

The working group has an [AnonCreds Specification](https://discord.com/channels/905194001349627914/1037471404586709042) Discord channel for participants. Invitations for those interested: [https://discord.gg/hyperledger](https://discord.gg/hyperledger).
