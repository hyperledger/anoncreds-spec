## Security Considerations

There are a number of security considerations that issuers, holders, and
verifiers should be aware of when processing data described by this
specification. Ignoring or not understanding the implications of this section
can result in security vulnerabilities.

While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security considerations,
it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to seek the advice of security
and cryptography professionals when implementing mission critical systems using
the technology outlined in this specification.

### Zero Knowledge Proofs in AnonCreds

The security of AnonCreds is primarily based on the security of the AnonCreds
cryptography, and in particular, the [[ref: zero knowledge proofs]] (ZKPs), upon
which this specification is based. Each ZKP used in AnonCreds requires
the following security properties be met, as introduced in many ZKP articles,
such as this one on [non-interactive zero knowledge proofs]:

- Completeness
  - If statement is true, a verifier will be convinced by prover.
- Soundness
  - If statement is false, a cheating prover cannot convince verifier it is true
    except with some negligible probability.
- Zero-Knowledge
  - The verifier learns nothing beyond the statement’s validity.

[non-interactive zero knowledge proofs]: http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Groth/ShortNIZK.pdf

These properties apply in the places where zero knowledge proofs are used in AnonCreds:

- No linkable identifiers for the holder are shared to the issuer during the
  issuing process, yet the [[ref: issuer]] is convinced by the [[ref: holder]]
  that the [[ref: holder]] knows the [[ref: link secret]] to which the
  credentials are to be issued.
  - The [[ref: issuer]] may know other correlatable data about the [[ref:
    holder]], but not the [[ref: link secret]] to which the credential is
    issued.
- No linkable identifiers for the holder are shared to the verifier during the
  presentation process, yet the [[ref: verifier]] is convinced by the [[ref:
  holder]] that the [[ref: holder]] knows the [[ref: link secret]] to which the
  credentials were issued.
  - The [[ref: verifier]] may receive [[ref: claims]] about the [[ref: holder]]
    that are correlatable, but not the [[ref: link secret]] to which the
    presented credentials were issued.
- Even though the signatures over the credentials in a presentation are
  generated to be unique per presentation by the [[ref: holder]], the [[ref:
  verifier]] is convinced that the presented signatures were derived from the
  signatures generated by the [[ref: issuer]] using the cryptographic
  information in the [[ref: credential definitions]] published by the [[ref:
  issuers]].
- The [[ref: verifier]] is convinced that the signatures in the presentation are
  valid despite the selective disclosure of [[ref: claims]] from the verifiable
  credentials.
- The [[ref: verifier]] is convinced that the presented predicates are true if
  and only if the requested predicate expression based on the [[ref: claim]]
  value is also true.
- The [[ref: verifier]] is convinced that the [[ref: holders]] source verifiable
  credentials are not revoked (assuming it is revocable) if the [[ref:
  non-revocation proofs]] generated by the [[ref: issuer]] are valid.

### Eavesdropping

The prevention of eavesdropping during the exchange of AnonCreds objects during
issuance and verification is outside the scope of this specification. The
security of the data shared between parties shall be protected by implementing
best practices in communications amongst mobile wallet and IT infrastructure,
like [ISO27001] and [Information Security Management] systems (ISMS). That said,
the AnonCreds cryptography prevents an eavesdropper from gaining other than any
plaintext information the parties of an interaction might intentionally or
accidentally share.

- Issuances are generated uniquely using nonces and the [[ref: holder]]'s
  generated [[ref: blinded link secret]] such that an eavesdropper that lacks
  knowledge of the holder's [[ref: link secret]] cannot replay the interaction
  or derive presentations from the verifiable credential.
- Presentation requests are generated uniquely using a nonce, and presentations
  are derived based on the [[ref: holder]]'s [[ref: link secret]] such that an
  eavesdropper that lacks knowledge of the holder's [[ref: link secret]] cannot
  replay the interaction or derive additional presentations from the source
  verifiable credentials.

### Replay

Replay prevention in AnonCreds for both issuances and presentations are
prevented through the use of nonces. During the 3-step issuance process the
[[ref: issuer]] (in the Credential Offer) and then the [[ref: holder]] (in the
Credential Request) provide and verify the use of nonces before proceeding.
Likewise in the presentation request, the [[ref: verifier]] provides a nonce
that is incorporated by the [[ref: holder]] in generating the presentation, and
verified by the [[ref: verifier]].

### Message Insertion and Modification

Message insertion and modification during AnonCreds exchanges is ineffective when
the secrets are securely protected by the [[ref: issuers]] and [[ref: holders]].
Arbitrary modification of AnonCreds data without access to the appropriate secret data is
detectable through the failure of the verification of the data objects. See the
security considerations sections about the [protection of
data](#protection-of-data) and [protection of key
material](#protection-of-key-material) for more on protecting those secrets and
the potentials impacts if those secrets are disclosed.

### Holder Collusion

[[ref: Holders]] that collude by sharing their [[ref: link secret]] could each
be issued credentials issued to the same [[ref: link secret]]. Subsequently,
such [[ref: holders]] could present any combination of the credentials together,
including generating a proof that they were all issued to the same [[ref: link
secret]]. Where such collusion is deemed a significant risk, such as with a
mobile wallet application, the agent software should protect the [[ref: link
secret]] so as to prevent access or extraction. [[ref: Issuers]] and [[ref:
Verifiers]] may choose to implement verifications that the [[ref: holder]] is
using a mobile wallet that is known to prevent such extraction and subsequent
collusion.

### Protection of data

The protection of data, both at rest and in motion, is outside the scope of this
specification. Protection of data should be accomplished by the participants
exchanging AnonCreds verifiable data implementing best practices in data
protection for mobile wallet and IT infrastructure, like [ISO27001] and
[Information Security Management] systems (ISMS). See the section on the
[protection of key material](#protection-of-key-material) for more on the
potential impact of disclosed secrets.

When verifiable credentials are stored on a device and that device is lost or
stolen, it might be possible for an attacker to use the victim's verifiable
credentials. Mitigating the impacts of such a loss include:

- Enabling password, pin, pattern, or biometric screen unlock protection on the
  device.
- Enabling password, biometric, or multi-factor authentication for the
  credential repository.
- Enabling password, biometric, or multi-factor authentication when accessing
  cryptographic keys.
- All or any combination of the above.

The potential risks in not adequately protecting data are covered in the
[eavesdropping](#eavesdropping), [message insertion and
modification](#message-insertion-and-modification) and [replay](#replay)
subsection of the Security Considerations.

### Protection of Key Material

The private keys associated with the public keys used by the [[ref: issuer]]
must be kept secret. Each [[ref: issuer]] is responsible for storing and using
their private keys and (for the [[ref: holder]]) the [[ref: link secret]] in a
sufficiently secure manner.

Unintended disclosure of [[ref: issuer]] secret information could allow others
with access to the secrets issue credentials as if from the original [[ref:
issuer]].

Unintended disclosure of the [[ref: holder]]'s [[ref: link secret]] could, if
accompanied by the disclosure of the holder's verifiable credentials, allow
others to present those credentials as their own. A malicious presenter could
not present their own credentials issued to a different [[ref: link secret]]
alongside the compromised verifiable credentials.

### Man-In-The-Middle

The prevention and detection of Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks during the
exchange of AnonCreds objects during issuance and verification is outside the
scope of this specification. Best practices in preventing MITM attacks while
establishing the communications channel between the parties through which the
data objects are exchanged should be followed by all of the participants.

As covered in the previous section on [Message Insertion and
Modification](#message-insertion-and-modification) issuance and presentations
processes are not susceptible to alteration by a MITM. The primary risk of MITM
attacks are the potential for collusion between [[ref: holders]] interacting
with a [[ref: verifier]]. For example, a MITM interacts with a verifier to
respond to a presentation request by colluding (in real-time) with a set of one
or more [[ref: holders]] to pass on each presentation request and get a
presentation from the most suitable [[ref: holder]] for each individual
presentation request. This attack can be mitigated by requesting presentations
that are satisfied from multiple source credentials, which will be verified to
show all are bound to the same [[ref: link secret]].

### Deletion

The handling of the deletion of AnonCreds objects by the various participants is
outside the scope of this specification. Such objects may be deleted by the
participants at any time, understanding that once done, the operations enabled
by the possession of those objects cannot be performed. For example, an issuer
losing the issuance and revocation private keys can no longer issue or revoke
credentials. Likewise, a [[ref: holder]] can't provide a presentation of a
deleted source credential. Protection from inadvertent deletion of such data
shall be protected by implementing best practices in data management by mobile
wallet and IT infrastructure, like [ISO27001] and [Information Security
Management] systems (ISMS).

### Denial of Service

Denial of Service attacks against the various participants in AnonCreds
exchanges are outside the scope of this specification.

### Storage or Network Amplification

Storage or network amplification attacks against the various participants in
AnonCreds exchanges are outside the scope of this specification.

## Residual Risks

The residual risks inherent in AnonCreds include:

- Compromise in the used cryptographic primitives used in AnonCreds v1, as
  described in this specification.
- Bugs in the AnonCreds implementations used by participants exchanging
  AnonCreds verifiable data.
- External libraries upon which the AnonCreds implementations are dependent.
